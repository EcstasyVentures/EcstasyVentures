                                Every great venture begins with a question. For us, it was simple: 
                                "Why do so many brilliant startup ideas in India never see the light of day?"
                            </p>

                                In 2024, our Founder & CEO, Jigar Shah, witnessed firsthand how thousands of aspiring entrepreneursâ€”especially from Tier-2 and Tier-3 Indiaâ€”struggled to take their ideas forward. The challenges weren't passion or innovation, but a lack of the right ecosystem: no access to advanced technology, no guidance on branding, complicated legal hurdles, and limited connections with investors.
                            </p>

                                That gap gave birth to Ecstasy Ventures Pvt Ltd (under Strivio Pvt Ltd).

                                We started with a bold belief:<br />

                                Unlike traditional agencies or consultants, Ecstasy Ventures was built as a co-builderâ€”a true partner for founders. Our unique equity-plus-services model ensures we grow with the startups we support.

                                Today, Ecstasy Ventures is more than a venture studio. It's a startup ecosystem enabler, designed to empower 1,000+ entrepreneurs in the coming decade, and prove to the world that world-class businesses can rise from every corner of India.
